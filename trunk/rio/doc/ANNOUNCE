For your perusal -- Rio 0.3.2

== Overview

Rio is a Ruby I/O convenience class wrapping much of the functionality
of IO, File and Dir. Rio also uses Pathname, FileUtils, Tempfile,
StringIO, OpenURI, Zlib, and CSV to provide similar functionality using
a simple consistent interface. In addition to forwarding the interfaces
provided by IO, File, and Dir to an appropriate object, Rio provides
a "grande" interface that allows many common application-level I/O and
file-system tasks to be expressed succinctly.


== New for version 0.3.2

* Based on a suggestion by Wybo Decker and code attributed to Nobu Nokada, 
  Rio now supports temporary directories in addition to temporary files.
* Bug fixes
* More tests and documentation.


== Version 0.3.1

A Rio is and can manipulate:
* a path
* the string representing that path
* the file, directory, web-page, or IO object to which that path refers
* the object created by opening that file or directory.

A Rio open itself, closes itself and selects its mode based on how it
used and the object referenced.

== Grande interface

With the grande interface you can:

Copy...
 rio('afile') > astring                    # a file into a string
 rio('afile') < astring                    # a string into a file
 rio('afile') > anarray                    # lines of a file into array
 rio('afile') < anarray                    # an array into a file
 rio('afile') > rio('another_file')        # a file into another file
 rio('adir') > rio('another_directory')    # a directory into another
 rio('http://rubydoc.org/') > rio('afile') # a web page into a file

Iterate...
 rio('adir').entries { |entrio| ... }      # over directory entries
 rio('adir').files { |entrio| ... }        # over only files
 rio('adir').dirs { |entrio| ... }         # over only directories
 rio('afile').lines { |line| ... }         # over lines in a file

Create an array...
 rio('adir').files[]                       # of files
 rio('adir').dirs[]                        # of directories
 rio('afile').lines[]                      # of lines

Whether copying, iterating or returning an array
Rio provides common input manipulations

 rio('afile').chomp > anarray              # chomped lines to an array
 anarray = rio('afile').chomp[]            # same thing
 rio('afile.gz').gzip > rio('afile')       # ungzip a file
 rio('afile.gz').gzip < rio('afile')       # gzip a file
 rio('afile.gz').chomp { |line| ...}       # iterate chomped lines

Whether copying, iterating or returning an array
Rio provides simple input selection

 rio('afile').lines(0..9) > rio('file2')   # the first 10 lines
 rio('afile').lines(/Rio/) { |line| ...}   # lines containing 'Rio'
 anarray = rio('adir').files['*.rb']       # ruby files

Manipulation and selection methods can be combined

 rio('afile').gzip.lines(/Rio/) > astring  # 'Rio' lines from gz file
 anarray = rio('afile').chomp[0..9]        # first 10 lines chomped
